</p>Hello my name is Trevor Card. I am technically
a second year student but I have only attended for one semester that 
is why I am in freshman seminars. I went to 
Christian County Highschool in Hopkinsville Ky but I 
am originally from Lansford Pa. I was a 2022 graduate. I really enjoy playing video games
and watching sports primarily football and basketball.</p>
